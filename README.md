# is-zero-zero

A Python project that explores multiple programmatic techniques to determine whether `0 == 0`.

## 🧠 What’s going on here?

Different problems demand different solutions — but what about problems that are already solved?

This project investigates one such case: verifying the equality of zero with itself.  
We explore a range of approaches — mathematical, logical, structural — to check if `0 == 0`, each with its own level of abstraction and interpretation.

It’s a growing collection of independent implementations, all converging on a single, predictable result.

## 🧪 How it works

Each function inside `is_zero_zero.py` returns `True` — that’s the only shared contract.  
The internal logic, however, is open to interpretation and creativity.

Here are a few existing methods:

- Using trigonometric identities  
- Shuffling lists  
- Unicode manipulation  
- Recursive reasoning  
- Memory footprint comparison  
- Empty iterable analysis  

Every function is valid in its own right — some are efficient, others... exploratory.

## 🧩 Sample

```python
def is_zero_by_unicode():
    return ord("0") - ord("0") == 0

def is_zero_by_trig():
    import math
    return round(math.cos(math.acos(0))) == 0
```

## 🤝 Contributing
New perspectives are welcome.

If you have an alternative approach to checking whether zero equals zero — regardless of how straightforward or unconventional — feel free to add a function and open a pull request.

Just make sure your method:
* Returns `True`
* Doesn’t reuse someone else’s logic exactly
* Brings a new angle to the problem

Creativity is encouraged. Simplicity is optional.

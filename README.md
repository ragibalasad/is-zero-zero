# 🧠 is-zero-zero ?

A completely unnecessary Python project that explores **dozens of ways** to prove, confirm, calculate, deduce, or spiritually interpret whether **zero equals zero**.

Why?  
Because I was bored. And I like stupid ideas.

## What is this?

This repo is a growing collection of unreasonably complicated ways to check if `0 == 0`.  
Yes, the answer is always `True`. No, that won't stop us.

---

## Example methods include:

- Using `math.acos` and `cos` to confirm 0
- Shuffling a list with just one zero in it
- Comparing the memory size of zero with itself
- Counting the length of an empty string
- Using recursion for no reason
- Rounding the sine of π
- Reading `"0"` from a formatted string and feeling proud

## How to contribute

Wanna make this dumber? You're welcome here.

All you have to do is:
1. Add a new function to `is_zero_zero.py` that returns `True` (because zero *is* zero).
2. Make it as cursed, overengineered, or unnecessarily clever as you want.
3. Bonus points if your logic makes someone question reality.
4. Open a pull request.

Examples:
```python
def is_zero_using_quantum_mechanics():
    # Replace with 12 lines of nonsense
    return True
```
Please **do not** write smart or clean code. We don’t do that here.

## How to run it 

``` 
python is_zero_zero.py
```
You'll see a bunch of checks that all (somehow) confirm that 0 is indeed 0.

## Why does this exist?

Because the internet needs more weird stuff.  
Because overengineering is a sport.  
Because someone once made a repo called `is_even` that checks if a number is even — with one function per number — and I felt challenged.

## License
MIT — because chaos should be free.
